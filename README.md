# 'Andy Chill' an NFT project by Xaniven.eth

Will anyone event read this?

Hello, I'm Xaniven.eth. I'm a 27yo self taught Web developer from the US.
This project was built as a side project to help build my portfolio. It is based off an idea I got after minting a "Chilmeleon" nft.
Discovering NFTs reignited my interest in coding and I soon started learning solidity to quickly realize unless I wanted to audit contracts
and stuff I'd need to learn web development too. I began watching Youtube videos, taking udemy courses, and completed the "Meta
Front-end Developer" Coursera course. I build a portfolio and ecommerce store to get some hands on learning and that all lead me to now.
I've reached a point where I can build a d'App and wanted to release it publicly. Hope you enjoy the ride and thanks for reading -Xaniven.eth

feel free to use this a a template for your web3 project!
