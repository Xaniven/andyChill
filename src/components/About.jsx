            Andy admired Warhol's ability to transform ordinary objects into captivating art.
            Inspired, he sought to emulate this brilliance. With each sunlit morning, Andy he would
            change his skin to reflect a different pop of color, and photograph it. He soon had
            recreated is idols work, and minted for all the world to enjoy.

            "Andy Chill" is an ERC-1155 project by Xaniven. This was an idea I had 2 years ago when
            I first got into NFT's but didn't have the technical skills to do it at the time. I have
            since learned solidity and web devlopment and wanted to bring the idea to fruition as a
            side project to help me get a job. This project is ment to be a perfomative art project
            and will change over time as I get new ideas and the skills to pull them off.
